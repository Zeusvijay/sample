								<p style=" border: 3px solid forestgreen; padding: 8px 5px 7px 10px;border-bottom-left-radius: 25px;border-top-right-radius: 25px;">Sarkar (transl.â€‰Government) is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language political action film[5][6] written and directed by AR Murugadoss, and produced by Kalanithi Maran under the banner of Sun Pictures. The dialogues were co-written by Murugadoss and B. Jeyamohan. The film stars Vijay, Keerthy Suresh and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar while Yogi Babu, Radha Ravi, and Pala. Karuppiah plays supporting roles. The film follows Sundar Ramaswamy, a non-resident Indian (NRI) who arrives in India from the United States to cast his vote in the election, only to find that his vote has already been recorded as cast. Sundar raises awareness against electoral fraud among the masses and decides to contest as a nonpartisan politician in the elections amidst several attempts made on his life and reputation.<br>
								Principal photography for Sarkar began in January 2018. Murugadoss collaborated with Vijay for a third time with Sarkar, which was the latter's 62nd film and given the tentative title of Thalapathy 62. In early December 2017, Sun Pictures agreed to produce the film. While Girish Gangadharan handled the cinematography, A. Sreekar Prasad served as the editor.</p>
